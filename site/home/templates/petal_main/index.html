   <h1>The Periodic Table of Life</h1>
   <p>The Periodic Table of Life (PeTaL) is a biomimetic system design inspiration tool. Engineers and researchers can approach PeTaL from a morphological, environmental, or functional perspective and walk away with a list of resources for biomimetic inspiration, and eventually, the partially- or fully-constructed solution itself. The current test case for PeTaL – the idea we need to build a working demo for – is a bio-inspired UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) system.

   <p><strong>PeTaL Philosophy:</strong></p>
   <p>Biomimicry, biophysics, biomimetics, bionics and numerous other terms refer to the use of biology and biological principles to inform practices in other disciplines. For the most part, the domain of inquiry in these fields have been confined to extant biological models with the proponents of biomimicry often citing the evolutionary success of extant organisms relative to extinct ones. Specialized fields such as paleomimesis, anthropomimesis and physioteleology in conjunction with artificial evolution will revolutinze biomimetics. The overarching philosophy outlined here can be thought of as physiomimetics, a holistic and systematic way of learning from natural history. The backbone of PeTaL integrates an unstructured database with an ontological model consisting of function, morphology, environment, state of matter and ecosystem. Tools include text classification, thesaurus, data visualization, and analysis. Applications of PeTaL include guiding human space exploration, understanding human and geological history, and discovering new or extinct life.
